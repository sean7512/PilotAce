# PilotAce

This is the code for the iOS game, Pilot Ace -- https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pilot-ace/id833488539?mt=8

This code is maintained in a separate, private repository.  Starting with the latest version (2.2) and all subsequent versions, the final codebase for each release will be updated here.

I hope this may help new Objective-C developers or new SpriteKit developers learn something new.

If you spot any issues or have improvements, please submit a pull request.
